				<p>An aspiring computer sorcerer.

			<p>I&rsquo;m an undergraduate studying computer science and
			linguistics student at UNSW. Within computer science, my interest
			is in programming language research and any possible intersection
			it may have with natural languages.

			<p>I tried programming many times growing up, but had given
			up each time until, ironically, I became interested in hardware
			design from building redstone circuits in Minecraft. I think
			approaching digital computers from the most fundamental level is
			what hooked me, and I&rsquo;ve wanted to study computer science
			ever since.

			<p>I became interested in programming language research after
			being exposed to the unique features of the Rust programming
			language, and Lisp dialects, namely ownership types and
			metaprogramming. To my mind, writing correct programs can become a
			painless experience with sufficient adoption of the products of
			programming language theory. I&rsquo;m inspired by the following
			quote:

				<blockquote cite='https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf'>
					A computational process is indeed much like a sorcererâ€™s idea of a
					spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter
					at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual
					work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by
					disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a
					factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a
					sorcerer&rsquo;s spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic
					expressions in arcane and esoteric <em>programming languages</em>
					that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote cite='https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf'>
					In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.

			<p>As for my interest in linguistics, I attribute it a few
			factors. I grew up in a Cantonese-speaking household, and was
			fortunate enough to study Japanese under excellent teachers in
			high school, so I have always held an appreciation for how
			languages differ. On top of that, I enjoy reading the legendarium of the
			J. R. R. Tolkien, who is well-known for having invented languages.
			One day, I should like to invent my own language.
